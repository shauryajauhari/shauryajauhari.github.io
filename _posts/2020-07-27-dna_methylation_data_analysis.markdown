<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p> DNA Methylation is essentially a epigenetic mechanism to orchestrate genes' expression in a cell. As the name suggests, it refers to the addition of a methyl (CH<sub>3</sub>) group to DNA nucleotides. This effect has various renditions and could be attributed to the normal or a tweaked phenotype. The most venerable methylation phenomena is the covalent addition of the methyl group at the 5-carbon of the cytosine ring resulting in 5-methylcytosine (5-mC), effectively inhibiting transcription. Contrarily, there is <i> DNA demethylation </i> that is the removal of methyl group from the DNA. This process too has some pertinent effects. A bried perusal of the topic could be found <a href= "https://github.com/rajnijauhari/Mora_Lab_Data/blob/master/Methylation_ppt.pptx" > here </a>. In the current exercise, we shall be handling bisulphite sequencing data. <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisulfite_sequencing" > <b>Bisulphite sequencing</b> </a> is the treatment of DNA before the routine sequencing tasks. </p>

<h2> Data </h2>

<p> This exercise is based on the study bt Lin et al. 2015 [1], the data for which is available <a href = "https://zenodo.org/record/557099#.Xx-kYR1S_ow" > here </a>. In consideration to the time for this workshop, the data will be a subset of the original data. But we get the due essence of the overall analysis. </p>

<h2> Tools </h2>

<p> We shall be ascertaining the quality of the data with <b>FASTQC</b>. A reckoner for the same is available <a href = "https://shauryajauhari.github.io/quality_control/" > here </a>. We shall also be using the <a href = "https://github.com/brentp/bwa-meth" > <b> bwameth </b> </a> for mapping the bisulphite-sequencing data against the reference genome. Also, a tutorial for installation of tools in Galaxy can be found <a href = "https://shauryajauhari.github.io/installing_tools_in_galaxy/" > here </a>. </p> 


<p> Let us download the files <i> subset_1.fastq </i> and <i> subset_2.fastq </i> from the link provided above and remove the file extension via renaming. </p>

<p><b>Exercise</b></p>
<ol>
<li> Run FASTQC on both the reads and examine the quality parameters. </li>
</ol>

<p> Next, we move towards aligning these paired-end reads to the reference genome. In this case we need to load the <i> Homo sapiens </i> genome version <b> hg38 </b>. Although, the genomes can be added to the local instance of the Galaxy (See <a href = "https://shauryajauhari.github.io/data_mapping/" > example </a>), should it require due to network or processing caveats, there is always an option to manually download the <a href = "http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/bigZips/" > sequence file </a> for the genome and add to the history, for further alignment processing. For a change of flavor, let us try the latter. </p>

<p> Since the genome is manually added to the history, the indicies are not available. The <i>bwameth</i> run will go an extra mile to build indicies first and then complete the alignment task. This certainly takes longer than expected. </p>
