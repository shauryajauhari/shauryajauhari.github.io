<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p align="justify"> In this tutorial, we shall learn to deal with classification problems using Galaxy. We shall examine <a href = "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/shauryajauhari/transcriptionFactoriesGREG/blob/master/MachineLearning/LogisticRegressionA549GREG.ipynb" > <b>Logistic Regression</b> </a> (a linear classifier), the <b>Nearest Neighbor</b> (a nonlinear classifier), <a href = "https://shauryajauhari.github.io/basics_of_machine_learning/" > <b>Support Vector Machines</b> </a>, <a href = "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/shauryajauhari/transcriptionFactoriesGREG/blob/master/MachineLearning/RandomForestsA549GREG.ipynb" > <b>Random Forest</b> </a> and other ensemble classifiers, with data visualization for each application. We will also explore ways to minimize the cost function.</p>

<h3> Supervised Learning </h3>

<p align="justify"> Classification is a supervised learning method in machine learning and the algorithm which is used for this learning task is called a classifier. The idea is to map data instances to certain pre-defined class labels, and this is carried by learning patterns from the attributes of the input data. We will perform a case study on cheminformatics data, arguing if a chemical substance is biodegradable; a purposeful examination that aligns to the environmental safety aspects. </p>
