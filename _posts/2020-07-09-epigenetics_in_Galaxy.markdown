<p> We are dealing with sequencing data, and the magnitude of data is so immersive that the efforts in analysis are very tedious and sophisticated. It is always better to make conscious choices of tools and their respective paramters, at every stage, as this may weed off any prospective errors.</p>

<p> Before delving into the epigenetic data analysis, let us cover the basics of <b>Quality Control</b> and <b>Data Mapping</b>. These pipelines are available from the official <b><a href= "https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/" > Galaxy Training service </a></b>, yet we have swiftly overviewed them at <a href = "http://shauryajauhari.github.io/quality_control/" > link1 </a> and <a href = "http://shauryajauhari.github.io/data_mapping/" > link2 </a>, respectively.</p>
