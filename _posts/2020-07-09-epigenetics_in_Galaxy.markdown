<p align="justify"> We are dealing with sequencing data, and the magnitude of data is so immersive that the efforts in analysis are very tedious and sophisticated. It is always better to make conscious choices of tools and their respective paramters, at every stage, as this may weed off any prospective errors.</p>

<p align="justify"> Before delving into the analysis of epigenetic data, let us cover the basics of <b>Quality Control</b> and <b>Data Mapping</b>. These pipelines are available from the official <b><a href= "https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/" > Galaxy Training service </a></b>, yet we have swiftly overviewed them at <a href = "https://shauryajauhari.github.io/quality_control/" > link1 </a> and <a href = "https://shauryajauhari.github.io/data_mapping/" > link2 </a>, respectively.</p>

<p align="justify"> I would also like to tabulate below, a list of tools that are pre-requisites to other pipelines (<i>Epigenetics in Galaxy</i> and <i>Machine Learning in Galaxy</i>). It is recommended to install the tools prior to beginning the hands-on session, so as to be fair with time in-hand. Additionally, the data on which the sessions are based may also take some time to download depending on the network access.</p>
