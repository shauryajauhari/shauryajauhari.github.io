<h2> Preface </h2>

<p> We've extensively discussed the theory behind several Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, namely <a href = "https://github.com/shauryajauhari/Machine_Learning/blob/master/Machine_Learning_Logistic_Regression/Logistic_Regression_Lab/glmnet_stats_glm_ep.pdf" > Logistic Regression </a>, <a href = "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/shauryajauhari/Machine_Learning/blob/master/Machine_Learning_Random_Forests/hands_on_random_forests_ep.ipynb" > Random Forests </a>, and <a href = "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/shauryajauhari/Machine_Learning/blob/master/Machine_Learning_Deep_Learning/hands_on_deep_learning_ep.ipynb" > Deep Learning </a>. These also encompass a practical application on the enhancer-prediction exercise (See <a href = "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/shauryajauhari/Machine_Learning/blob/master/Machine_Learning_Deep_Learning/enhancer_prediction_dataset_protocol.ipynb" > this </a>). I am not going to delve into that back again. Rather, in this session, let us figure out the ways to implement ML algorithms in Galaxy, from setting it up to inferring results. Let's cut to the chase. This tutorial has been sourced from this <a href = "https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/statistics/tutorials/machinelearning/tutorial.html" > link </a>. </p>

<p> In loose terms, ML can help with <i>classification</i>, <i>clustering</i>, and <i>regression</i> for the data to come up with meaningful patterns. </p>

<h2> Uploading Data </h2>

<p> The datasets required for this tutorial contain 9 features/ variables from profiling of breast cells which include the thickness of clump, cell-size, cell-shape, etc. In addition to these features, the training dataset contains one more column as <b>target</b>, or a class. It has a binary value (0 or 1) for each row. 0 indicates no breast cancer and 1 indicates breast cancer. The test dataset does not contain the target column. </p>

<p> The data we'll be using is listed below. Again, we can choose to upload the data via web-links (below) as mentioned in a previous tutorial.</p>

<h2> Setting up the Classifier </h2>

<p> Since we are interested in a classification problem, we shall be structuring a ML model or classifier that better represents the patterns in the data and encompasses it's inherent features. The efficiency of the classifier is solely derived from the data it is trained upon and hence it is on the utmost importance to provide <i> clean and comprehensive data </i> to bring out the best. </p>

<p> There are manu flavors of classifiers available out there, but for this exercise, we shall be using the <b> Support Vector Machines (SVMs) </b> to accomplish the task at hand. We will employ the <a href = "https://scikit-learn.org/stable/" > <i>scikit-learn</i> </a> library in python; search for <i><b>sklearn_svm_classifier</b></i> in the repository and install the tool.</p>
