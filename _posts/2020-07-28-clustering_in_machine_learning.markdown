<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p> For attentive audience, it must be known that the Machine Learning provides (broadly) for <i> clutering </i>, <i> classification </i>, and <i> regression </i> applications. In this module, we shall discover clustering, which is a form of <b> unsupervised learning </b>. </p>

<h3> Unsupervised Learning </h3>

<p> In crude terms, unsupervised learning means to learn from scratch. Imagine a dump of <i> unstructured </i> data    </p>
