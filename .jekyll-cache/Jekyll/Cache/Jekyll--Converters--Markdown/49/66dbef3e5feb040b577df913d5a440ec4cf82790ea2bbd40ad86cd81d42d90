I"ö<p>This has been a burning issue with high throughput genomic data analysts and enthusiasts. I wouldnâ€™t parse through the verticals and draw a comparative performance graph corresponding to variegated tools to carry out the aforementioned functioning; rather precisely serve THE protocol for one.</p>

<p>Bowtie has been the bread-n-butter alignment tool in practice. Ummmâ€¦letâ€™s cut to the chase here. Follow these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li> Align your reads to the reference genome (fasta sequence) sans -a option and including â€” no-discordant. What -a does is that it uniquely lists all reads that have aligned; even multiple times. In addition, we also donâ€™t want non-discordant reads, i.e. to say that we have only concordant reads.</li>
<li> Next step is to frisk the resultant SAM file to filter the reads with â€œXS:iâ€ tag. This tag is the hallmark of reads that have aligned to more than one loci in the reference genome. While every record in the SAM file will have a â€œAS:iâ€ tag, not all will have the former.</li>
<li> Now you can employ awk command in UNIX, to filter $1 (read id) and $10 (read sequence) from the SAM file. To move an extra mile for the paired-end data, you can have even rows representing read 1 and odd representing read 2. You must have the same count in both cases. The â€˜samtools flagstatâ€™ and â€˜bowtie summaryâ€™ also cross-validate your concern.</li>
<li> Voila, there you have it. These are your multiple aligned reads. </li>
</ol>

<p>More on that later. See you around.</p>
