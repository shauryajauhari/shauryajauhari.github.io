With a plebeian stint in orchestrating computer networks as a launching intern and masticating web-based services development as a Software Engineer, my initial career faction witnesses a healthy span of circa 3 years. Transitioning to research wasnâ€™t abrupt, albeit a decision on progressive wisdom from self-assessment and foresight.
I deem myself as a professional with a garnered research temperament and a creative vision. My Ph.D. tenure has enlightened me on the basis of molecular biology and what reflections can be construed from a computational standpoint. I am deeply gravitated towards gene expression data exploratory analysis and am open to the adaptation of novel tools and techniques that aid deciphering the objective at hand. Also, I am currently following the advances in the single-cell RNA-Seq and have gained some theoretical insights. I have also managed to cover some ground on working on Linux, engaging remote server for data analysis, Python, and R, and find mathematical modeling approachable too.
